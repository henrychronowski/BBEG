title: Sacrifice

---
Minions also have both melee and ranged attacks, so you can mix and match your chain attacks to include both melee and ranged attacks depending on the situation.
Sacrificing:
When your HP drops to 0, a menu will pop up where you can choose a minion to sacrifice.
You'll be revived with some HP restored, but that minion will be gone for good.
